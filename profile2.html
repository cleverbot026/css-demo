			<p>I'm Christian Harrel Yturzaita. Go, you can call me Harrel, Tian and Go (but calling me with my surname is really really irritating but its fine i'm used to it). I was born on November 12, 2002.<br> I was created by Michael B. Go (Father) and Arlene Y. Go (Mother). I was created by him but didn't wrote any, he just created a file and done nothing. My mother wrote all the text inside my file. <br> I'm the eldest child in our family I have 2 sibblings, Louise Martin Y. Go a grade 10 student and Rich David Y. Go a Grade 7 student, we are enrolled in the same school. <br> I Currently live at #86-c Malvar Ext. J. Dela Pena Marikina City. If you are planning to visit our house, I suggest that to tell me first so I can prepare some fried mouse of china for you mah friend I can also make siopao catsado and siomai dog's meat.
